# Source track - AI for Retail -  Challenges

## **About Source -** https://www.source.shop/

Source is building the future of **AI-native procurement and retail operations**, enabling businesses to make faster, smarter, and more automated decisions using their real operational data. The platform connects disparate systems—**ERP exports, spreadsheets, sales data, and inventory records**—and transforms them into structured, actionable intelligence.

## About the track

Most businesses today still run on **traditional systems**—ERP tools, Excel spreadsheets, and siloed databases.

Large Language Models have **never been natively trained** on this kind of operational data, even though it powers the majority of the world’s economy.

Retailers in particular manage their core processes—**finance, inventory, sales, supply chain, operations**—through ERPs and manual spreadsheets.

These systems contain extremely valuable information: **inventory**, **supplier lists**, **sales**, **customer records**, and more.

For this track, you’ll be working with **real operational data from a pharmacy with 20,000+ products**.

## **Important Notes**

1. **The data is messy.**
    
    Expect human errors—duplicate SKUs, inconsistent naming, typos, mismatched formats.
    
2. **LLMs are inconsistent.**
    
    When dealing with sales, inventory, or customer-level data, they often hallucinate or make assumptions. Guardrails are needed.
    
3. **Format consistency is hard.**
    
    Getting LLMs to generate reliable purchase orders, reports, or Excel structures requires creative constraints.
    

> Creative, robust approaches will be essential.
